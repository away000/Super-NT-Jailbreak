(template targeting issues with ROMs, feel free to adapt the structure below to your actual problem)

## Expected behavior and actual behavior

## Steps to reproduce the problem

## ROM name and hash value

On Mac and Linux, use command line tools to get the hash values of your ROM (for example: `sha1sum`, `md5sum`). On Windows, you can use the [FCIV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/889768/how-to-compute-the-md5-or-sha-1-cryptographic-hash-values-for-a-file) utility.

If applicable, check against byuu's [SNES dump database](https://preservation.byuu.org/) and indicate if the bug occurs when using an original cartridge as well.

## firmware version and SD card model

- Jailbreak firmware v6.4
- relevant Super Nt settings
