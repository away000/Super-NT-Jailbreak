(template targeting issues with ROMs, feel free to adapt the structure below to your actual problem)

(Do not submit bugs if you are using any means of powering your Super Nt other than the OEM power supply. Only use the original PSU and USB cable when bug testing)

(Please be ready to retest your issue if the firmware is updated)

## Expected behavior and actual behavior

## Steps to reproduce the problem

## ROM name and hash value

On Mac and Linux, use command line tools to get the hash values of your ROM (for example: `sha1sum`, `md5sum`). On Windows, you can use the [FCIV](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/889768/how-to-compute-the-md5-or-sha-1-cryptographic-hash-values-for-a-file) utility.

If applicable, check against byuu's [SNES dump database](https://preservation.byuu.org/) and indicate if the bug occurs when using an original cartridge as well.

## firmware version and SD card model

- Jailbreak firmware v6.4
- relevant Super Nt settings
